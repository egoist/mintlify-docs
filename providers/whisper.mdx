Koe supports transcribing audio files locally on your computer. This is useful if you have sensitive audio files that you don't want to upload to the cloud.

This is powered by running [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) locally on your device.

You can manage Whisper models in **Settings > Whisper**:
